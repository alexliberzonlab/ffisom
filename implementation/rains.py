'''
This is an implementation of E. Rains'
<http://www.math.caltech.edu/people/rains.html> algorithm for
isomorphisms of finite fields.

Given two finite fields represented as F_p[X]/f(X) and F_p[X]/g(X),
with f and g irreducible of degree n, it finds generators α, β such
that the extension of α ↦ β defines an isomorphism, and outputs
change-of-basis matrices for the two directions.

The algorithm for finding the generators α and β is implemented by
`find_gens` and described in its docstring.

    3. ℤ/m* = <p^o> × G for some G ⊂ ℤ/m*;

    then return o and a set of generators for G, together with their
    respective orders.

    The first condition implies that the m-th roots of unity generate
    a superfield of F_{p^r}.

    The second condition is not strictly necessary, but it makes
    the algorithm much more efficient by ensuring that the superfield
    is generated over F_{p^n} by a polynomial with coefficients in F_p.

    When r strictly divides n, the weaker condition:

    2'. gcd(n, r⋅o / gcd(n, r⋅o)) = 1; 

    can be used to work in a smaller superfield.

    The third condition is needed so that the construction of
    `find_unique_orbit` applies. In his paper, Rains' gives a
    sufficient condition for (3), namely that

    3'. gcd(r, φ(m)/r) = 1.

    It is easy to see that this condition is also necessary when ℤ/m*
    is cyclic, but there are easy counterexamples when it is not

    function `sieve` below, with acceptance criterion given by (1),
    (2) and (3').

    To conclude: bounds on m, hard to tell. When r is prime, m must be
    prime, and under GRH the best bound is m ∈ O(r^{2.4 + ε})
    [1]. Heuristically m ∈ O(r log r).  Pinch [2] and Rains give some
    tabulations.

    two fixes in his paper, which we haven't implemented yet.

    '''
    Given p, n and r, find the smallest integer m such that there
    exists an element of multiplicative order r in ℤ/m.

    This is equivalent to the condition: for each prime power r'|r,
    there exists a prime power m'|m such that r'|φ(m'). One immediate
    consequence is that r|φ(m).

    The output is a list of pairs of integers (m_i, r_i, o_i), such that

    - m_i is a prime power;
    - the m_i are pairwise coprime and m = ∏ m_i;
    - the r_i are pairwise coprime and r = ∏ r_i;
    - r_i · o_i = φ(m_i).

    The optional parameter `accept` can be passed in order to put
    additional constraints on m. If it is given, it must be a function
    satisfying:

    - it takes six arguments (p, n, r, l, e, s), where p, n, r, l and e
      are integers and s is the factorization of an integer
      (a `Factorization` object);
    - it returns a boolean;
    - let s and t be coprime, accept(p, n, r, l, e, s·t) returns `True` iff
      accept(p, n, r, l, e, s) and accept(p, n, r, l, e, t) also return `True`.

    Then, assuming m_i = l_i^e_i, with l_i prime, the output also
    satisfies

    - accept(p, n, r, l_i, e_i, r_i) returns `True` for any i.

    The obvious use case for `accept` is to ensure that a specific
    element of ℤ/m has order r (or divisible by r), instead of any
    element, e.g. p in the case of Rains' algorithm.

    ## Algorithm

    The algorithm starts by factoring r into prime powers r_i. For
    each r_i, it finds the smallest prime power m_i = l_i^e_i such
    that r_i|φ(m_i) and `accept(p, n, r, l_i, e_i, r_i)` returns `True`
    (if `accept` is provided).

    At this point, the lcm of all the m_i is an acceptable value for
    m, although not necessarily the smallest one. More generally, let

      r_{1,...,s} = r₁ · r₂ ··· r_s

    for some subset of the r_i (up to renumbering), then the lcm of
    m₁, ..., m_s is an acceptable value for r_{1,...,s}, although not
    necessarily the smallest one. Call m_{1,...,s} this optimal value.
    The algorithm goes on by computing the optimal values m_X for
    larger and larger subsets X ⊂ {r_i}, until r is reached.

    This is done by testing all the possible prime powers between the
    largest m_Y already computed for any proper subset Y ⊂ X, and the
    smallest lcm(m_W, m_Z) for any proper partition X = W ∪ Z with
    W ∩ Z = ∅.

    For any given r' = r_{1,...,s}, the algorithm looks for primes of
    the form k·r' + 1. If r_s = l_s^e_s is the largest prime factor of
    r' and if

      r₁ · r₂ ··· r_{s-1} | l_s - 1

    the algorithm also looks for powers of l_s. It is easy to show
    that the algorithm needs consider no other integer.

    ### Example

    Let r = 60 = 4·3·5

    The algorithm starts by computing

      m_{4} = 1·4 + 1 = 5,
      m_{3} = 2·3 + 1 = 7,
      m_{5} = 2·5 + 1 = 11.

    Then it considers all possible pairs of factors. For {4,3}, one
    possible value is 5·7 = 35. 2 divides 3-1, hence the algorithm
    looks for primes and powers of 3 comprised between 7 and 35. It
    finds that 13 is a suitable value, hence

      m_{4,3} = 1·12 + 1 = 13,

    and similarly

      m_{4,5} = 25, m_{3,5} = 31.

    Finally, it considers all three factors. It is useless to test
    prime powers below 31, because 3 and 5 must divide them. There are
    three possible partitions of {4,3,5} into two disjoints sets:

      lcm(m_{4}, m_{3,5}) = 155
      lcm(m_{3}, m_{4,5}) = 175
      lcm(m_{5}, m_{4,3}) = 143

    hence 143 is an acceptable value, and the algorithm needs to test
    no further. The first value tried is 1·60 + 1 = 61, and it turns
    out it is a prime, hence the algorithm returns

      [(61, 60)].

    ### Complexity

    The complexity is obviously polynomial in r. Heuristically, it
    should be sublinear, the dominating step being the factorization
    of r, but it is not so easy to prove it.

    If c is the number of primary factors of r, the main loop is
    executed 2^c times, which is clearly sublinear in r.

    At each iteration, all partitions of the current subset into two
    disjoint subsets must be considered, hence a very crude lower
    bound for this combinatorial step is

      ∑_{i=1}^{c} binom(c,i) (2^{i-1} - 1) < 3^c << e^{o(log r)}

    The most expensive operation of each cycle is the primality
    testing (and, eventually, the `accept` function). Heuristically,
    at each iteration O(log r) primality tests are needed, each with a
    polynomial cost in log r. As noted in `find_root_order`, the best
    bounds under GRH give O(r^{1.4 + ε}) primality tests, instead.

    Whatever the provable complexity is, this algorithm is extremely
    fast in practice, and can handle sizes which are way beyond the
    tractability of the other steps of Rains' algorithm.

    The Gaussian period is defined as follows. Let ζ be any m-th root
    of unity of k, define the Gaussian period

      η = ∑_{g∈G} ζ^g

    To prove (a), let e ∈ ℤ/m* be written as e = h⋅p^{o⋅i}, then

      ∑_{g∈G} (ζ^e)^g = (∑_{g∈G} ζ^{g⋅h})^{p^{o⋅i}} = η^{p^{o⋅i}},

    hence η does not depend on the choice of ζ.

    To prove (b), write p = h⋅p^{o⋅i}. Then p^r = h^r ∈ G, hence
    η^{p^r} = η by the same equation as above.

    An elementary proof of (c) eludes me. Rains proves that if m is
    squarefree, then η generates F_{p^r}. Rains' proof is based
    on the study of cyclotomic rings and their reduction at (p), a
    classical topic in algebraic number theory. The proof is not very
    hard, but I would like to find one by more elementary means, like
    for (a) and (b).
    There are examples where m is squareful, and yet η generates F_{p^n},
    though it is not true in general.
    One idea I tried, is to observe that if η is in a smaller
    subfield, then we have an equation

      ∑_{g ∈ G} ζ^g = ∑_{g ∈ xG} ζ^g

    for some coset xG where x = p^{o⋅i}. This gives a linear relation
    on 2⋅#G m-th roots of unity, something which I was trying to prove
    impossible. There is a good deal of literature on linear
    dependencies of roots of unity in ℂ, but I haven't found any on
    finite fields. An old result by Mann [1] tells that for such a
    relation to happen in ℂ, m needs to divide the product of all the
    primes up to 2⋅#G + 1 (which is unlikely to happen in our case). I
    have no idea of how to adapt this to finite fields, but it doesn't
    seem impossible to do.

    As an optimization that is not implemented here, notice that if
    ℤ/m* = <p> × G' for some other group G' ⊂ G, then there is an
    uniquely defined element

      Θ = ∑_{g ∈ G'} ζ^g

    in k, and η is the trace of θ over F_{p^r}.

    Complexity of this phase: Finding a root ζ is done in O(1) trials,
    each costing O(n⋅o) multiplications in k. The Gaussian period is
    the sum of O(m/n) elements of k, each of which is computed with
    O(log m) multiplications in k. By computing the powers ζ^g smartly
    (not done here), one can obviously do all the job with only
    O(log m) multiplications and O(m/n) additions.
