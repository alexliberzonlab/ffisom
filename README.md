#### Abstract

Let *ùîΩ<sub>q</sub>* be a finite field.  Given two irreducible
polynomials *f*, *g* over *ùîΩ<sub>q</sub>*, with deg *f* dividing deg
*g*, the finite field embedding problem asks to compute an explicit
description of a field embedding of *ùîΩ<sub>q</sub>[X]/f(X)* into
*ùîΩ<sub>q</sub>[Y]/g(Y)*.  When deg *f* = deg *g*, this is also known
as the isomorphism problem.

This problem, a special instance of polynomial factorization, plays a
central role in computer algebra software.  We review previous
algorithms, due to Lenstra, Allombert, Rains, and Narayanan, and
propose improvements and generalizations.  Our detailed complexity
analysis shows that our newly proposed variants are at least as
efficient as previously known algorithms, and in many cases
significantly better.

We also implement most of the presented algorithms, compare them with
the state of the art computer algebra software, and make the code
available as open source.  Our experiments show that our new variants
consistently outperform available software.
