# Examples and benchmarks [![launch binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/defeo/ffisom/master?filepath=notebooks)

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks to complement the paper and
implementation. The notebooks may be *viewed statically* by clicking
on them, or **excecuted** and modified **dynamically** in
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/defeo/ffisom/master?filepath=notebooks).

### <library_usage_example.ipynb>

Contains examples on how to use our software library through the
SageMath front-end.

### <benchmarks.ipynb>

Contains plots visualising the performances of our implementation,
compared to PARI/GP and Magma.

### <elliptic_periods_conjecture.ipynb>

An exploration of our conjecture on elliptic periods in SageMath.
