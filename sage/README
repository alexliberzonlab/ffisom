To try out the different algorithms from Sage:
* be sure to have cloned the ffisom repo (from defeo)
* have a very recent Sage install (at least 5.10.beta7)
* go into this directory (ffisom/sage)
* copy external code by:
  * running "make download",
  * or copying ../ffisom_impl into ./javad
    and cloning ellmul repo (from jpflori)
* run "make" from a Sage shell (sage -sh -c make)
* add the current directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
* launch Sage
* "import ffisom"
* have fun
