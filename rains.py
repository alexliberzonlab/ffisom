'''
This is an implementation of E. Rains'
<http://www.math.caltech.edu/people/rains.html> algorithm for
isomorphisms of finite fields.

Given two finite fields represented as F_p[X]/f(X) and F_p[X]/g(X),
with f and g irreducible of degree n, it finds generators α, β such
that the extension of α ↦ β defines an isomorphism, and outputs
change-of-basis matrices for the two directions.

The algorithm for finding the generators α and β is implemented by
`find_gens_cyclotomic` and described in its docstring.

    '''
    Search for a small integer m such that:

    1. the order of <p> ⊂ ℤ/m* is equal to n⋅o;
    2. gcd(n, o) = 1;
    3. ℤ/m* = <p^o> × G for some G ⊂ ℤ/m*;

    then return o and a set of generators for G, together with their
    respective orders.

    Rains also requires m to be square-free, but we like to live
    dangerously.

    The first condition implies that the m-th roots of unity generate
    a superfield of F_{p^n}. The second condition is not strictly
    necessary, but it makes the algorithm much more efficient by
    insuring that the superfield is generated over F_{p^n} by a
    polynomial with coefficients in F_p.

    The third condition is needed so that the construction of
    `find_unique_orbit` applies. In his paper, Rains' gives a
    sufficient condition for (3), namely that

    3'. gcd(n, φ(m)/n) = 1.

    It is easy to see that this condition is also necessary when ℤ/m*
    is cyclic, but there are easy counterexamples when it is not
    (e.g., take p=233, n=6, m=21).

    The algorithm implemented here factors n, then for each prime
    power finds an m_i satisfying (1)-(3). Since the m_i must be prime
    powers, we use condition (3') (with some adaptation for powers of
    2) to insure (3). Then, the lcm of all the m_i is used as m.
    
    This algorithm always computes the smallest m when n is a prime
    power. It may compute a subotimal m otherwise: e.g., p=2, n=6
    gives m=21, but m=9 is also a solution. It is doable, although
    painful to adapt the algorithm to always find the smallest m.

    To conclude: bounds on m, hard to tell. When n is prime, m must be
    prime, and under GRH the best bound is m ∈ O(n^{2.4 + ε})
    [1]. Heuristically m ∈ O(n log n).  Pinch [2] and Rains give some
    tabulations.

def find_unique_orbit(k, G):
    '''
    Given a field k isomorphic to F_{p^{n⋅o}}, and a group G ⊂ ℤ/m*
    satisfying the conditions of `find_root_order`, i.e.

    1. <p> ⊂ ℤ/m* is of order n⋅o,
    2. gcd(n, o) = 1,
    3. ℤ/m* = <p^o> × G,

    return a Gaussian period of m-th roots of unity of k that is

    a. uniquely defined up to the action of Gal(k/F_p),
    b. stable under Gal(k/F_{p^n}),
    c. a generator of F_{p^n}.

    The Gaussian period is defined as follows. Let ζ be any m-th root
    of unity of k, define the Gaussian period

      η = ∑_{g∈G} ζ^g

    To prove (a), let n ∈ ℤ/m* be written as n = h⋅p^{o⋅i}, then

      ∑_{g∈G} (ζ^n)^g = (∑_{g∈G} ζ^{g⋅h})^{p^{o⋅i}} = η^{p^{o⋅i}}.

    To prove (b), write p = h⋅p^{o⋅i}. Then p^n = h^n ∈ G, hence
    η^{p^n} = η by the same equation as above.

    An elementary proof of (c) eludes me. Rains proves that if m is
    squarefree, then η generates F_{p^n}. There are examples where m
    is squareful, and yet η generates F_{p^n}. Rains' proof is based
    on the study of cyclotomic rings and their reduction at (p), a
    classical topic in algebraic number theory. The proof is not very
    hard, but I would like to find one by more elementary means, like
    for (a) and (b).

    One idea I tried, is to observe that if η is in a smaller
    subfield, then we have an equation

      ∑_{g ∈ G} ζ^g = ∑_{g ∈ xG} ζ^g

    for some coset xG where x = p^{o⋅i}. This gives a linear relation
    on 2⋅#G m-th roots of unity, something which I was trying to prove
    impossible. There is a good deal of literature on linear
    dependencies of roots of unity in ℂ, but I haven't find any on
    finite fields. An old result by Mann [1] tells that for such a
    relation to happen in ℂ, m needs to divide the product of all the
    primes up to 2⋅#G + 1 (which is unlikely to happen in our case). I
    have no idea of how to adapt this to finite fields, but it doesn't
    seem impossible to do.

    As an optimization that is not implemented here, notice that if
    ℤ/m* = <p> × G' for some other group G' ⊂ G, then there is an
    uniquely defined element

      Θ = ∑_{g ∈ G'} ζ^g

    in k, and η is the trace of θ over F_{p^n}.

    Complexity of this phase. Finding a root ζ is done in O(1) trials,
    each costing O(n⋅o) multiplications in k. The Gaussian period is
    the sum of O(m/n) elements of k, each of which is computed with
    O(log m) multiplications in k. By computing the powers ζ^g smartly
    (not done here), one can obviously do all the job with only
    O(log m) multiplications and O(m/n) additions.
